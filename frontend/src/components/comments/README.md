# Comment ID Generation in React & Redux

In your React and Redux application, we have created a unique identifier (ID) for each comment and reply.

## ID Structure

The ID is composed using string interpolation in JavaScript and includes:

1. **Post ID (`postId`)**: The identifier of the post that the comment or reply is associated with.
2. **Timestamp (`Date.now()`)**: The current time in milliseconds since the Unix Epoch (January 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC).
3. **Random String (`Math.random().toString(36).substr(2, 9)`)**: A unique random string.

### Example of Creating an ID:

```jsx
const newComment = {
    id: `${postId}-${Date.now()}-${Math.random().toString(36).substr(2, 9)}`,
    text: commentText,
    timestamp: Date.now(),
    replies: [],
};
```

This will generate IDs like `post1-1617922800000-123abc`.

This method is practical for small to medium-sized applications. However, for large-scale applications or production-level systems, a more robust method for generating unique IDs might be necessary.
